BY SUBMITING THIS FILE TO CARMEN, I CERTIFY THAT I HAVE PERFORMED ALL
OF THE WORK TO DETERMINE THE ANSWERS FOUND WITHIN THIS FILE MYSELF WITH
NO ASSISTANCE FROM ANY PERSON OTHER THAN THE INSTRUCTOR OF THIS COURSE
OR ONE OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE GRADERS.

HOURS WORKED: 6.5 hours

Hardest: it was definitly trying to figure out search. It took me 6 hours out of the 6.5 hours i worked on
that garb method. For some reason when i tried to do search the decrementing way it would always give me a
saucy seg fault >:( so I ended up trying to fix the method step by step but found that by just increamnting the array pointer by 8 bytes i could just loop through the array like how we did for string copy.

Easiest: literally the rest of the lab was freelo, cash, freer than a costco smaple tbh. Jk but not really.
